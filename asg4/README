Project description: This project requires students to create a meaningful animation with parallax and two way sprites.

Extra Contribution: Created my own sprites, except for the pizza which is from Wikipedia under GFDL. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pizza#/media/File:Eq_it-na_pizza-margherita_sep2005_sml.jpg

Problems with this project: The tracker might take time to "find" the first sprite.
This is because my sprites chose random start locations which might not be in the viewport when it loads. I realized this 40 minutes before submmission was due and did not have enough time to correct it.
I tried to create an overlay but wasn't able to before the deadline. This does not impact the requirements for submission in anyway.
