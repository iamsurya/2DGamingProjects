Project description: The project introduces students to handin by asking them to submit a zip file containing their mugshot.

Extra Contribution: I may have possibly inserted encrypted passwords to my Tesla, but there's no way to tell.

Problems with this project: I spent way more time than I should have trying to decide if I should virtualize a linux install, dual boot or just ssh to CPSC servers.
