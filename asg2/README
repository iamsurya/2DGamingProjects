Project description: This project requires students to use at least two classes that follow Scott Meyers rules.

Extra Contribution: Used Alpha channel blending. Used equations for a 2D helix. I also added pizza since I read there were extra points for pizzazz.

Problems with this project: A segfault is caused if an image file cannot be located (it should instead throw a text error).

I should've used polymorphism to seperate the sprites, but this project doesn't require that.

I had to use engine->getRandom(100, 5); on line 259 because I didn't know any other way of calling a static class constructor, and I put the game loop in the constructor. (Maybe I shouldn't have.) Removing the function call would cause a warning that the variable was unused.

I also created two variables to limit the frames created for genFrames but used only one.
