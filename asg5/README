Project description: This project requires the creation of an HUD, player control using the keyboard and using painters algorithm.

Extra Contribution: All sprites and images were created by me.

Game description: The game is set inside a biological cell. The player has to eat smaller microbes and grow bigger: scoring more points while avoiding larger microbes.
Enemies become faster and increase in number as the score increases. The game ends when the player is eaten by a larger microbe or becomes the largest microbe (reaching a score of 20,000).

I'm not sure if I'm correctly using const everywhere.

To Do: The player class should probably be a Myers Singleton.
To Do: I think I'm using magic numbers in two places, I should move them to the XML file.
To Do: The green objects look like they are sprites but they are a part of the parallax effect. Turn them into sprites maybe?
To Do: Fix sprite images. Resizing them from a larger image to sprite size leaves a pink border around them.


Additional Information on how the game works:
One full list of microbes exists for a total of 6 microbes. When the game starts new sprites are added to the delicious and scary list based on the delicious and scary names. As time goes on, the lowest
microbe in the scary name is moved to the delicious name, and a new scary name is added.
