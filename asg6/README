Project no: 5
Project due date: 11/22/2016

Project description: This project requires an almost complete game with explosions, object pools, collisions, and projectiles* (see Notes).

Extra Contribution:
This game is completely modular! To make the game longer, all you need to do is add another png to the images folder, and update the
XML file with the correct monster numbers and <MonsterX> tag where X is the number for the new monster. Difficulty can be changed by
changing values in the XML file.

See lines 175 - 188 of game.xml to change the number of monsters on screen.
****
I recommend you change <numInitialScaryNames> to 2 and see how the game changes :)

Game description: The game is set inside a biological cell. The player has to eat smaller microbes and grow bigger, scoring more points while avoiding larger microbes.
Enemies become increase in number and size as the score increases. The game ends when the player is eaten by a larger microbe or becomes the largest microbe (reaching
a score of 5,000, but remember this number depends on the number of total monsters defined in the XML (1000 X (Number of total monsters - numInitialDeliciousNames)).  

Use asdw to move and avoid the monster indicated in the top right.

Notes:
Object Pools: The monsters are split into two pools delicious sprites and scary sprites. When the player score reaches a multiple
of 1000, the game enters the next level where all current scary sprites are moved to delicious sprites, and new scary sprites are
created.

**** FEATURES NOT IMPLEMENTED ****
* Projectiles were removed from the requirements because they didn't fit the theme.
Parallax: The game is very fast and parallax effects only make it more confusing.

The player will move in a random direction if both a+d or w+s are pressed. I decided not to fix this because of two reasons: 
1) The player movement is very fluid already.
2) The game requires nimble fingers and if the gamer stays at the same place, he will probably die.
[ This is a feature, not a bug ;) ]

I tried to add sound but every sound I tried causes segfaults. I'm not sure how I will approach this for Assignment 6.
Kinda disaapointed because the pop sounds really good when an object explodes.

Cheat Keys:
1: Increase score by 100
2: Decrease score by 100
8 : Sets the score to 900. This helps call nextLevel() faster which is called everytime the score reaches a multiple of 1000
9 : Explode the player
